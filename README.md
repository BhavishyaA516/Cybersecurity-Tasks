Cyber security is the application of technologies, processes, and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices and data from cyber attacks. It aims to reduce the risk of cyber attacks and protect against the unauthorised exploitation of systems, networks, and technologies.

Cyber security basics
Before diving into advanced security measures, it's essential to understand the fundamental concepts and practices that form the foundation of effective cyber security.

Essential security concepts
Understanding these basic principles is crucial for protecting your organisation:

Authentication is how systems verify who's trying to access them. Think of it as showing your ID to prove who you are. Modern authentication often uses multiple factors:

Something you know (password)
Something you have (security key)
Something you are (fingerprint)
Authorisation determines what verified users can access. Just as employees have different access levels to building areas, digital authorisation ensures users can only access appropriate resources.

Confidentiality keeps sensitive information private. This means ensuring data is only accessible to those who need it, using tools like encryption and access controls.

Integrity ensures data hasn't been tampered with. Systems must maintain the accuracy and completeness of information throughout its lifecycle.

Availability means keeping systems and data accessible to authorised users when needed while protecting against disruptions like cyber attacks.

Common threat types
These are the most frequent cyber threats your organisation may face:

Social engineering involves manipulating people to reveal confidential information. The attacker might pose as a trusted person or authority figure to gain access or information.

Malware (malicious software) can damage systems or steal data. This includes:

Viruses that spread between systems
Spyware that monitors user activity
Trojans that appear legitimate but contain harmful code
Phishing attempts to steal sensitive data by masquerading as trustworthy entities. These attacks often arrive via email and can target specific individuals or organisations.

Ransomware encrypts your data and demands payment for its release. This can halt operations and cause significant financial damage.

Data breaches occur when unauthorised parties gain access to confidential information, often through a combination of the above methods.

Basic security measures
Implement these fundamental practices to establish basic protection:

Strong password practices

Create unique passwords for each account
Use at least 12 characters combining letters, numbers, and symbols
Enable multi-factor authentication wherever possible
Consider using a password manager to secure and organise credentials
Regular software updates

Enable automatic updates where appropriate
Check for updates weekly on critical systems
Apply security patches as soon as they're available
Maintain an inventory of all software requiring updates
Data backup

Back up critical data at least weekly
Store backups in multiple locations
Keep at least one backup offline
Regularly test your ability to restore from backups
